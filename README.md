My graduation project , which I used Kotlin and Flutter for making the application, besides of the software me and my team used Arduino IDE to write some functional code on ESP32 microcontroller for the project.

The project idea resembles about a patient needs to know if he may have some diseases or not by answering some questions by start the assessment session on the application , the assessment is powered by EndlessMedical.com API , where it shows for him some questions accepts integer values and dropdown list answers.

Not stopping only at the assessment to learn more about top 10 disease he may get affected , the aim of the project shows that the AI cant replace the profession of the doctor in the future.
